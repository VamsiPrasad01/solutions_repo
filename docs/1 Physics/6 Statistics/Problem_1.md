Great! Let's now structure and create the CLT simulation exploration following the style of **Problem 1**. This version will include **colored sections**, **in-depth explanation**, **click-to-view Python code**, and **three visual illustrations** with detailed descriptions.

### **<span style="color:#28B463">1.1 What is the Central Limit Theorem?</span>**

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** states that:

> As the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample mean approaches a **normal distribution**, regardless of the population's original distribution.

Key Points:

* Applies to **independent, identically distributed** (i.i.d.) variables.
* Sample size â‰¥ 30 is typically considered sufficient for approximation.
* Works even if the population is **non-normal** (e.g., skewed, discrete).

### **<span style="color:#28B463">2.1 Population Distributions</span>**

We will use the following as our underlying populations:

* **<span style="color:#E67E22">Uniform Distribution</span>** (flat and bounded)
* **<span style="color:#E67E22">Exponential Distribution</span>** (skewed right)
* **<span style="color:#E67E22">Binomial Distribution</span>** (discrete)

Each population will be generated using **10,000** samples.

### **<span style="color:#28B463">2.2 Sampling Strategy</span>**

For each distribution:

* Sample sizes: 5, 10, 30, 50
* 1,000 repeated samples for each size
* Compute mean of each sample
* Plot **histograms of sample means**

        axes[i].set_ylabel('Frequency')

    plt.show()

# Example usage
simulate_clt('uniform', {'low': 0, 'high': 100}, [5, 10, 30, 50])
simulate_clt('exponential', {'scale': 10}, [5, 10, 30, 50])
simulate_clt('binomial', {'n': 10, 'p': 0.5}, [5, 10, 30, 50])

## **<span style="color:#E74C3C">5. Insights and Analysis</span>**

### **<span style="color:#28B463">5.1 Rate of Convergence</span>**

* **Uniform** converges quickly due to symmetry and low skew.
* **Exponential** requires larger sample sizes because of its skewed nature.
* **Binomial**'s convergence depends on *n* and *p*; becomes more symmetric as *n* increases.

### **<span style="color:#28B463">5.2 Effect of Variance</span>**

* Populations with **larger variances** yield **wider sampling distributions**.
* But all converge to a **mean-centered bell curve** with enough samples.

## **<span style="color:#2E86C1">Conclusion</span>**

Through simulation and visualization, we've seen the power and generality of the **Central Limit Theorem**. Regardless of population shape, the distribution of sample means becomes **approximately normal**, providing a robust foundation for **inference, hypothesis testing, and real-world predictions**.
