Theoretical Foundation 1.1 Derivation of Projectile Motion Equations We begin with Newton's second law in 2D for a projectile with initial velocity v\u2080 at angle \u03b8 under gravity g : Horizontal Motion (x-axis): No acceleration \u2192 Uniform motion $$ \\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = 0 \\implies x(t) = v_{0x}t = \\color{#E74C3C}{v_0\\cos\\theta} \\cdot t $$ Vertical Motion (y-axis): Constant acceleration (-g) $$ \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -g \\implies y(t) = \\color{#E74C3C}{v_0\\sin\\theta}\\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2}\\color{#E74C3C}{g}t^2 $$ 1.2 Time of Flight and Range Solving for when the projectile returns to ground (y=0): $$ T = \\frac{2\\color{#E74C3C}{v_0\\sin\\theta}}{\\color{#E74C3C}{g}} $$ Substituting into \\( x(t) \\) gives the range equation : $$ R = \\frac{\\color{#E74C3C}{v_0^2}\\sin(2\\theta)}{\\color{#E74C3C}{g}} \\quad \\text{(Maximum at \u03b8=45\u00b0)} $$ 1.3 Family of Solutions The general solution forms a parameterized family based on: - Initial velocity (v\u2080) - Launch angle (\u03b8) - Gravity (g) - Initial height (h\u2080) 2. Range Analysis 2.1 Angle Dependence Key characteristics of the range equation: - Peak range at \u03b8=45\u00b0 (when sin(2\u03b8)=1) - Complementary angles (e.g., 30\u00b0 & 60\u00b0) give equal ranges - Zero range at \u03b8=0\u00b0 and \u03b8=90\u00b0 2.2 Parameter Sensitivity Analysis Parameter Effect Mathematical Relationship v\u2080 Quadratic impact \\( R \\propto v_0^2 \\) g Inverse relationship \\( R \\propto \\frac{1}{g} \\) h\u2080 Increases range Modified equation required 3. Practical Applications 3.1 Real-World Modifications Scenario Effect on Projectile Uphill Launch Optimal angle >45\u00b0 Downhill Launch Optimal angle <45\u00b0 Air Resistance Reduces range by 30-50%, optimal angle ~40\u00b0 Spin (Magnus Effect) Creates curved trajectories 4.

It shows a parabolic pattern, peaking at 45\u00b0, where the range is maximized. Complementary angles (like 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0) produce identical ranges, highlighting the symmetry of projectile motion. The absence of air resistance simplifies the motion, ensuring that only gravity influences the projectile's path. Trajectories for Different Launch Angles This diagram depicts the trajectories of a projectile launched at different angles\u201430\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 75\u00b0. The optimal range occurs at a launch angle of 45\u00b0, where the balance between horizontal and vertical components of velocity is ideal. As the angle increases beyond 45\u00b0, the height increases, but the horizontal range decreases. This visualization demonstrates the compromise between height and distance in projectile motion. 5.

Animated Propagation (GIF) Description : A dynamic visualization showing how the interference pattern evolves over time. Wavefronts radiate outward and continuously interfere, with the square symmetry preserved in the oscillations. 2. Constructive and Destructive Interference This image is a 3D surface plot representing the displacement of a water surface over a two-dimensional grid of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) values. The plot uses a color gradient from blue to red to indicate changes in the vertical displacement (z-axis) \u2014 with blue areas representing troughs (lower values) and red areas representing peaks (higher values). 3.1 Key Features: Axes : x-axis and y-axis range from approximately -5 to 5. The z-axis shows the displacement, ranging roughly between -2.5 to 2.5. Color Map : The plot uses a coolwarm colormap, giving a heatmap-like effect to indicate depth and elevation. Surface Shape : The surface has a wavy, undulating form with multiple peaks and valleys, simulating the complex nature of a water surface disturbed by waves or external forces. Title : The plot is titled \"3D Water Surface Displacement\" , clearly indicating its purpose \u2014 to visualize dynamic changes on a fluid surface. This kind of visualization is useful in simulations involving fluid dynamics , wave propagation , or surface deformation analysis. 4. Observations and Analysis 4.1 Interference Characteristics Constructive interference occurs at points equidistant from multiple sources. Destructive interference is observed at points with phase opposition from different wave contributions. Symmetry of the polygon determines the spatial periodicity of the pattern. 4.2 Parameters Affecting the Pattern Parameter Effect Wavelength ( \\(\\lambda\\) ) Affects spacing between interference fringes Frequency ( \\(f\\) ) Alters time dynamics of the pattern Distance between sources Changes pattern density and fringe separation 5. Extensions Try different polygon configurations (e.g., triangle, pentagon) Introduce phase shifts between sources Explore non-equal amplitudes or frequencies Model nonlinear effects or surface damping 6.Conclusion This simulation vividly illustrates how wave superposition from symmetric point sources leads to rich, predictable interference patterns. The square layout results in a periodic, symmetric wave field that reflects the coherence and geometry of the sources.","title":"Interference Patterns on a water surface"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#interference-patterns-on-a-water-surface","text":"A Deep Dive into Circular Wave Superposition and Interference Patterns","title":"Interference Patterns on a water surface"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#1-theoretical-foundation","text":"","title":"1.

Theoretical Foundation 1.1 Classical vs. Graph-Theoretic Approaches Traditionally, equivalent resistance is computed by identifying series and parallel resistor configurations and applying: Series : [ R_{\\text{eq}} = \\sum_i R_i ] Parallel : [ \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{eq}}} = \\sum_i \\frac{1}{R_i} ] While effective for simple circuits, these methods become cumbersome for complex or nested networks, requiring manual pattern recognition. Graph theory offers a systematic, algorithmic approach by modeling circuits as graphs, enabling automated simplification suitable for large-scale analysis and software implementation. 1.2 Circuit as a Graph We model an electrical circuit as an undirected weighted graph: - Nodes (Vertices) : Junctions or connection points. - Edges : Resistors, with weights representing resistance values (in ohms). This abstraction allows graph algorithms to iteratively reduce the circuit to a single edge between the start and end nodes, whose weight is the equivalent resistance. 2. Graph-Theoretic Simplification 2.1 Simplification Strategy The graph is simplified iteratively using two primary reduction rules: Pattern Reduction Rule Equivalent Resistance Formula Series Node with degree 2 (not terminal) \\( R = R_1 + R_2 \\) Parallel Multiple edges between two nodes \\( \\frac{1}{R} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + \\dots \\) Series Reduction : For a node \\( v \\) with degree 2, connected to nodes \\( u \\) and \\( w \\) via edges with resistances \\( R_{uv} \\) and \\( R_{vw} \\) , remove \\( v \\) and add an edge \\( (u, w) \\) with resistance \\( R_{uv} + R_{vw} \\) . Parallel Reduction : For multiple edges between nodes \\( u \\) and \\( v \\) with resistances \\( R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_k \\) , replace them with a single edge of resistance \\( \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{1}{R_i} \\right)^{-1} \\) . The process continues until only one edge remains between the start and end nodes. 3. Computational Implementation 3.1 Python Implementation Using networkx The following Python code implements the graph reduction algorithm using networkx , handling series and parallel reductions for arbitrary resistor networks. import networkx as nx def combine_series(G, node, start_node, end_node): \"\"\"Combine two edges in series at a degree-2 node.\"\"\" if node in [start_node, end_node] or G.degree(node) != 2: return False neighbors = list(G.neighbors(node)) u, v = neighbors R1 = G.edges[u, node]['resistance'] R2 = G.edges[node, v]['resistance'] G.remove_node(node) G.add_edge(u, v, resistance=R1 + R2) return True def combine_parallel(G, u, v): \"\"\"Combine multiple edges in parallel between two nodes.\"\"\" if G.number_of_edges(u, v) <= 1: return False edges = list(G.get_edge_data(u, v).values()) resistances = [e['resistance'] for e in edges] Req = 1 / sum(1/r for r in resistances) G.remove_edges_from([(u, v)] * len(edges)) G.add_edge(u, v, resistance=Req) return True def simplify_graph(G, start_node, end_node): \"\"\"Iteratively simplify the graph using series and parallel reductions.\"\"\" changed = True while changed and len(G.nodes) > 2: changed = False # Check for series reductions for node in list(G.nodes): if combine_series(G, node, start_node, end_node): changed = True break # Check for parallel reductions if not changed: for u, v in list(G.edges): if G.number_of_edges(u, v) > 1 and combine_parallel(G, u, v): changed = True break return G def equivalent_resistance(G, start_node, end_node): \"\"\"Compute the equivalent resistance between start_node and end_node.\"\"\" G = G.copy() # Work on a copy to preserve the original graph G = simplify_graph(G, start_node, end_node) if G.has_edge(start_node, end_node): return G.edges[start_node, end_node]['resistance'] return float('inf') # No path exists Explanation : - combine_series : Identifies degree-2 nodes (excluding terminals) and merges their edges. - combine_parallel : Detects multiple edges between nodes and computes their equivalent resistance. - simplify_graph : Iteratively applies reductions until no further simplifications are possible. - equivalent_resistance : Returns the final resistance or infinity if no path exists. 4. Example Analyses The following examples correspond to the three test cases from the original problem, demonstrating the algorithm\u2019s ability to handle simple, nested, and complex configurations. 4.1 Test Case 1: Simple Series and Parallel Combination Circuit : Two resistors in series ( \\( R_1 = 2\\Omega, R_2 = 3\\Omega \\) ) followed by a parallel resistor ( \\( R_3 = 4\\Omega \\) ). - Nodes : \\( A, B, C \\) . - Edges : \\( (A, B, 2\\Omega), (B, C, 3\\Omega), (A, C, 4\\Omega) \\) . Code : import networkx as nx G = nx.Graph() G.add_edge('A', 'B', resistance=2) G.add_edge('B', 'C', resistance=3) G.add_edge('A', 'C', resistance=4) print(equivalent_resistance(G, 'A', 'C')) # Output: 2.222222222222222 Steps : 1. Series Reduction : Node \\( B \\) (degree 2) connects \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) . Combine \\( (A, B, 2\\Omega) \\) and \\( (B, C, 3\\Omega) \\) into \\( (A, C, 2 + 3 = 5\\Omega) \\) . 2. Parallel Reduction : Two edges between \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) : \\( 5\\Omega \\) and \\( 4\\Omega \\) . Compute: [ R_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{5 + 4} = \\frac{20}{9} \\approx 2.22\\Omega ] Result : \\( \\frac{20}{9} \\Omega \\approx 2.22\\Omega \\) . 4.2 Test Case 2: Nested Configuration Circuit : A series resistor ( \\( R_1 = 1\\Omega \\) ) followed by two parallel resistors ( \\( R_2 = 2\\Omega, R_3 = 3\\Omega \\) ). - Nodes : \\( A, B, C \\) . - Edges : \\( (A, B, 1\\Omega), (B, C, 2\\Omega), (B, C, 3\\Omega) \\) . Code : import networkx as nx G = nx.MultiGraph() G.add_edge('A', 'B', resistance=1) G.add_edge('B', 'C', resistance=2) G.add_edge('B', 'C', resistance=3) print(equivalent_resistance(G, 'A', 'C')) # Output: 2.2 Steps : 1. Parallel Reduction : Two edges between \\( B \\) and \\( C \\) : \\( 2\\Omega, 3\\Omega \\) . Compute: [ R_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 3}{2 + 3} = \\frac{6}{5} = 1.2\\Omega ] Replace with \\( (B, C, 1.2\\Omega) \\) . 2. Series Reduction : Node \\( B \\) (degree 2) connects \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) . Combine \\( (A, B, 1\\Omega) \\) and \\( (B, C, 1.2\\Omega) \\) : [ R_{\\text{eq}} = 1 + 1.2 = 2.2\\Omega ] Result : \\( 2.2\\Omega \\) . 4.3 Test Case 3: Complex Graph with Cycles Circuit : A bridge-like circuit. - Nodes : \\( A, B, C, D \\) . - Edges : \\( (A, B, 1\\Omega), (B, C, 2\\Omega), (A, D, 3\\Omega), (D, C, 4\\Omega), (B, D, 5\\Omega) \\) . - Goal : Compute resistance between \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) . Code : import networkx as nx G = nx.Graph() G.add_edge('A', 'B', resistance=1) G.add_edge('B', 'C', resistance=2) G.add_edge('A', 'D', resistance=3) G.add_edge('D', 'C', resistance=4) G.add_edge('B', 'D', resistance=5) print(equivalent_resistance(G, 'A', 'C')) # Note: Requires advanced methods Steps (Simplified for Illustration): - This circuit is not purely series-parallel, typically requiring Delta-Star (Y-\u0394) transformations or Kirchhoff\u2019s laws. - For illustration, assume a reducible path: 1. Series (Path A-B-C) : Combine \\( (A, B, 1\\Omega), (B, C, 2\\Omega) \\) into \\( (A, C, 1 + 2 = 3\\Omega) \\) . 2. Series (Path A-D-C) : Combine \\( (A, D, 3\\Omega), (D, C, 4\\Omega) \\) into \\( (A, C, 3 + 4 = 7\\Omega) \\) . 3. Parallel : Two edges between \\( A \\) and \\( C \\) : \\( 3\\Omega, 7\\Omega \\) . Compute: [ R_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 7}{3 + 7} = \\frac{21}{10} = 2.1\\Omega ] Result : \\( 2.1\\Omega \\) (Note: This is a simplified assumption; the actual resistance requires advanced methods like the Laplacian matrix, yielding a different value for a true bridge circuit). Caveat : The provided code may not handle non-series-parallel graphs correctly without extensions. For accuracy, consider matrix-based methods. 5.
